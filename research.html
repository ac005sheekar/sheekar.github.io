             <p> In this research, we initiated a unique and cutting-edge backbone neural network for the conventional YOLO algorithm which we named as SBHK-Net. The network boosted up the performance of the existing YOLO algorithm drastically which manifests a strong potential of improving tracking and recognition accuracies of other conventional algorithms in the robot vision industry as well. It has the greatest accuracy 59.2% AP among all known real-time object detectors with 30 FPS or above on GPU RTX3060, and it outperforms all other known object detectors in the range of 5 FPS to 160 FPS. We used YOLOv7 as our reference point for the core research. The transformer-based detector SWINL Cascade-Mask R-CNN (9.2 FPS A100, 53.9% AP) and the convolutional detector ConvNeXt-XL Cascade-Mask R-CNN (8.6 FPS A100, 55.2% AP) are both outperformed by the SBHK-Net core object detector (56 FPS RTX3060, 56.4% AP) in terms of speed and accuracy, respectively.</p>

             <p> We focused upon the deep learning approach to classify the normal and abnormal breast according to the medical imaging from the MIAS dataset of Mammograms and Pixel Intensity. The Convolution Neural Network (CNN) alongside ResNet, AmoebaNet and EfficientNet have been used for the detection with 330 mammograms in which 194 images are normal and 136 are having the identification of abnormal breasts. The accuracy of the entire experimental results was carrying the torch of potential legacy of deep learning in the medical imaging arena. The research is ongoing for the further development and optimization of CNN, AmoebaNet-C and EfficientNet architecture for the Pixel Intensity with higher accuracy, proper segmentation and masking.</p>

It features the service of active reconnaissance mode with LIDAR sensor, location tracking with GPS Neo 6M module, visual information collection, person detection, weapons detection and identification, gender and age prediction of the hostile and other artificial threat detection, etc. Remote navigation plays as the core controlling system of the robot which is also modifiable through replacement with Internet and satellite navigation system.

The sensory data provides the information of underwater whether the naval environment is habitable for the marine biological species or not, under the terrible effect of global climate change. The submarine prototype is fully functional in the surface and underwater scenario which contains a very unique mechanical design and circuitry with an exceptional sensor data streaming capability which can be used by marine biological researchers and oceanographers professionally as a full-fledged marine ecosystem monitoring device.</p>

They were manifested with Deep Neural Networks like CNN, LSTM and NLP with different environments and approaches. Our primary concern was to combine and optimize all of the approaches in a single platform of a University Automation System as much as possible having Keras as backend. The accuracy rate seems to be very promising through the amalgamation of CNN layers and LSTM with NLP features.</p>

                <p> In the rural world of medical services, we
                  generally notice a lot of havoc which generally happens
                  in the hospitals, clinics and related other medical
                  centers. The conditions of Intensive Care Units (ICU) of
                  the rural areas are quite intolerable because of the lack
                  of qualified nurses. Doctors generally prescribe multiple
                  injections for a single patient for each day. Nurses are
                  responsible for the injection process but unfortunately
                  they fail to perform the injection process very often in
                  proper prescribed time in proper amount. This
                  malpractice of treatment quite often results in the
                  terrible sufferings of the ICU patients and sometimes a
                  few patients even die. This study aims to minimize the
                  hazard at the highest accuracy level possible. The
                  research relates to the functionality of Real Time Clock
                  (RTC) which provides the activation of automated time
                  system and triggers the microcontroller's machinery to
                  act according to the time. According to the doctor's
                  prescribed time, injection's medicine will be flowing
                  inside the pipelines and will be injected to the body of
                  the patient through a cannula. In this study, Arduino
                  microcontroller, RTC DS3231 time module, HX 711
                  weight sensors, relay modules, hydraulic pump motors,
                  wifi shield, resistors, MOSFET and breadboard have
                  been used. Following the prescribed time of doctor, the
                  RTC module programs the time for the activation of the
                  microcontroller. The microcontroller activates the
                  hydraulic pump motors following the programmed
                  times. The pump motors then create a vacuum
                  environment inside the pipeline and pass the medicine
                  fluid for injection inside the patient's body through the
                  multiple channel-single cannula. This is consisted of
                  three units: electrical circuitry unit, mechanical unit
                  and timer program with reprogram process unit. The
                  research were carried out through the tests of each and
                  every units to verify that they were working precisely
                  and were manifesting the expected outputs.</p>
