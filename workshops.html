                The NASA Solve-Bangladesh Chapter arranged a "Young Scientist Meetup" at the City University in 
                2019. I attended consecutively two workshops in that event. They were: "Astronaut Workshop" and 
                "Rocket Design Principle - Basic". My purpose behind doing those workshops were to find out the problems 
                inside the ongoing space technology and solve them with some better technology. At that time, I was 
                a core practitioner of Robotics. My intention was to find out the space related problems which I 
                could solve with robotics.

                  In 19 October 2019, I led my undergrad university team to attend the Cloud Camp (Azure) in 
                  Jahangirnagar University. That camp was arranged by the Microsoft Student Partners- Bangladesh Chapter. 
                  I was very enthusiastic to learn about the cloud architecture and networking components of 
                  Azure inside out. So I hopped into the camp and took 7 more junior students with me. 
                  We learnt about the Azure services for web and mobile application development, cloud operations, 
                  blockchain, Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine Learning ToolKits. It was a great time indeed!
